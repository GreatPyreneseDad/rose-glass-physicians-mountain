### To: 
**Dr. Carolyn C. Meltzer**, Dean, Keck School of Medicine of USC  
**Dr. Chantal Young**, Director of Medical Student Wellness & Director, Office of Well-being

### From:
**MacGregor Holding Company** (Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business)  
Christopher MacGregor, Principal

### Date: 
December 2025

## Executive Summary

We propose piloting **Rose Glass Physicians Mountain**, a professional formation tool that helps medical students develop sustainable practices for processing the emotional cost of clinical work—starting before their first patient death, not after their tenth.

This is not a wellness assessment. It does not score students, predict burnout, or report to administration. It provides **translation frameworks** that give students language for experiences they don't yet have words for, and pathways for transforming inevitable grief into accumulated wisdom.

**The ask**: A 12-month pilot with one cohort of MS3 students entering clinical rotations, integrated with existing Keck wellness infrastructure.

**The investment**: $15,000 for the pilot year (approximately $80/student for a cohort of 186).

**The outcome**: Measurable data on reflective capacity, peer support utilization, and self-reported processing—publishable findings that advance the field.

## The Problem You Already Know

Dr. Young named it in her Voyage LA interview:

> *"Medical schools across the country are finally starting to employ wellness professionals to address long-standing mental health concerns... I envision a national uprising against some of the problems in medical school training, such as... the lack of opportunities for emotional processing of patient suffering and death."*

Keck has built exceptional infrastructure:
- Keck Checks (mental health check-ins for all MS1s)
- Mandatory wellness days for clerkship students
- Keck Peer Support for confidential counseling
- Supportive group sessions for students beginning clinical work

What's missing: **a framework for what happens inside those sessions.**

Students have access to support. What they often lack is *language* for what they're experiencing when they watch a patient die, break bad news to a family, or carry a case home that won't leave their mind. Without language, processing stalls. Grief accumulates as weight rather than transforming into wisdom.

## What Rose Glass Physicians Mountain Does

### Translation, Not Measurement

The system translates student expressions—journal entries, reflections, debriefs—into pattern dimensions that prompt self-reflection. It does **not**:

- Score "wellness" or "burnout risk"
- Predict who will struggle
- Report anything to faculty or administration
- Create profiles or assessments

It **does**:

- Give students vocabulary for the continuum between "full presence" and "protective distance"
- Distinguish between compassion fatigue (traumatic stress) and burnout (exhaustion)
- Provide frameworks for deliberate rumination (controlled processing vs. intrusive thoughts)
- Surface patterns over time that students can reflect on privately
- Offer cultural bridge guidance for cross-cultural end-of-life communication

### The Core Insight

Grief must be processed to become wisdom. Unprocessed grief accumulates as weight. Processed grief compresses into knowledge that can serve others.

The physicians who sustain 30-year careers in oncology aren't the ones who feel less. They're the ones who have frameworks for transforming what they feel into something they carry differently.

We can teach those frameworks *before* the weight accumulates—during formation, not after crisis.

## Why Keck

### Alignment with Existing Philosophy

Dr. Meltzer's stated priority: *"Empathetic leadership... trauma-informed leadership."*

Dr. Young's framing: *"People are naturally motivated to do their best work when their emotional, physical, financial, social, and spiritual needs are reasonably met, and they feel safe to be their full selves."*

Rose Glass operates from the same foundation. It creates safety by ensuring students own their reflections. It supports full selfhood by giving language to experiences that otherwise remain unnamed.

### Integration Points

The framework enhances existing Keck programs without replacing them:

| Existing Program | Rose Glass Integration |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Keck Checks (MS1) | Pre-clinical baseline; introduce vocabulary before first patient contact |
| Clerkship group debriefs | Structured reflection prompts; grief-to-wisdom frameworks |
| Wellness days | Self-guided processing using personal Rose Glass history |
| Peer Support | Shared vocabulary enables peer processing without requiring disclosure |

### Research Opportunity

Keck already surveys students on wellness. Rose Glass adds dimensionality:

- **Reflective capacity**: Can students articulate what they're carrying?
- **Processing pathway awareness**: Do they know the difference between intrusive rumination and deliberate processing?
- **Cultural bridge confidence**: Do they feel equipped for cross-cultural EOL conversations?
- **Wisdom accumulation**: Over four years, does grief transform or simply accumulate?

Longitudinal data across a cohort—MS3 through residency—would be publishable and field-advancing.

## The Pilot Proposal

### Cohort
MS3 students entering clinical rotations (approximately 186 students)

### Duration
12 months (academic year)

### Components

**1. Onboarding Module (2 hours)**
- Introduction to grief-to-wisdom framework
- Vocabulary for compassion states (presence, protective distance, fatigue, burnout)
- Cultural bridge foundations
- Clear messaging: *This is yours. It doesn't report. It doesn't score.*

**2. Integration with Clerkship Debriefs**
- Facilitator guides for existing group sessions
- Structured reflection prompts aligned with Rose Glass dimensions
- Optional: students can share patterns (never content) with peers

**3. Self-Guided Processing**
- Students access personal Rose Glass instance
- Private journaling with pattern translation
- Longitudinal tracking they control

**4. Milestone Modules**
- First patient death
- First pediatric case
- First time breaking bad news alone
- First case that follows them home

**5. Measurement (Opt-In)**
- Pre/post surveys on reflective capacity
- Self-reported processing confidence
- Cultural bridge readiness
- Qualitative interviews (subset)

### Deliverables to Keck

- Aggregate (anonymized) pattern data for program evaluation
- Curriculum integration guide for future cohorts
- Co-authored publication on pilot outcomes
- Recommendations for expansion to residency programs

---

## Investment

### Pilot Year: $15,000

Includes:
- Platform access for 186 students (12 months)
- Onboarding module development and delivery
- Facilitator training for debrief integration
- Milestone module content
- Measurement design and analysis
- Final report and publication support

### Per-Student Cost
Approximately **$80/student/year**—less than one textbook.

### Ongoing (Post-Pilot)
If successful, institutional license at $50-75/student/year for continued cohorts, with portable accounts students carry into residency.

## Why Now

LCME accreditation increasingly emphasizes student wellness competencies. The Surgeon General's 2022 advisory on health worker burnout elevated institutional accountability. Medical schools are under pressure to demonstrate wellness infrastructure.

Most responses have been reactive: crisis hotlines, counseling access, wellness days. These matter. But they address symptoms, not formation.

Rose Glass offers **proactive professional formation**—teaching students to process the cost of caring work before the cost becomes crisis.

Keck has the infrastructure, the leadership commitment, and the research orientation to pilot this properly. The question is whether you want to be the institution that advances the field, or the one that adopts it later.

## About MacGregor Holding Company

MacGregor Holding Company is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) specializing in cultural translation frameworks for high-stakes human contexts.

The Rose Glass framework emerged from work in:
- Federal human performance contracts (DEA, pending)
- Athletic organization culture assessment
- Medical professional resilience

The Physicians Mountain extension was developed in collaboration with oncology fellows at a major academic medical center, grounded in peer-reviewed research on physician burnout, compassion fatigue, post-traumatic growth, and cultural competency in end-of-life care.

## Next Steps

We propose a 45-minute conversation with Dr. Young and relevant stakeholders to:

1. Demonstrate the framework in action (live simulation)
2. Discuss integration with existing Keck wellness infrastructure
3. Identify optimal cohort and timeline for pilot
4. Address questions about data ownership, privacy, and measurement

We are also open to a smaller proof-of-concept (single clerkship rotation, ~30 students) if preferred before full cohort commitment.

---

## Closing

The students entering Keck's MS3 year will, within months, watch patients die. Some will be children. Some will be patients they've followed for months. All will leave marks.

They deserve more than crisis resources for after the weight accumulates. They deserve frameworks for carrying it differently from the start.

Rose Glass Physicians Mountain offers those frameworks—not as surveillance, not as assessment, but as professional formation. Language for what they'll experience. Pathways for transforming it. Wisdom they can carry forward into careers that span decades.

Keck has built the wellness infrastructure. We're offering the translation layer that makes it transformative.

*"The only way to get through it is not to say, 'These are my failures, these are the patients that died.' Rather, if you say, 'These family members are the ones who are going to live on and be successful, productive members of society and not have severe depression the rest of their lives'—then that's a contribution."*
